#Findings from WeatherPy

#We can observe that the maximum temperature is at the highest when it is at the equator and it gets lower as it head towards the poles (North and South Poles). This evident considering the facts that Antarctica and the Arctic are some of the coldest areas on the Earth.

#The cloudiness gets higher as it head towards the far North considering we can see trends increasing on both Latitude v Cloudiness graphs on the Northern and Southern hemispheres provided with their positive gradients.

#The correlations of latitude vs humidity, cloudiness and wind speed have a very weak correlation since the points are scattered whilst compared to latitude vs max temperature which has a very strong correlation since the graphs have points very close to each other. This is due to the three except for maximum temperature varying between countries.
